The goal of this project is to make a tool for the game called Re-Volt. 
Re-Volt is a racing game released in 1999 where the game determines AI cars quite randomly. 
There are 2 ways to control what cars the AI uses: car rating and what cars the game loads.
At the moment this project version 0.1 focuses on what cars the game loads by moving folders around.
At the moment this project focuses only on empty folders, next step is to also move files inside of it.
The folder AICarSelector/bin/Debug/net6.0windows/cars contains 29 example empty folders for cars.
The program creates copies of those folders to AICarSelector/bin/Debug/net6.0windows/carsForAI depending on user input.
